# 3D Printed Mario Powerups and Box

These are 3D Printed Super Mario "power ups" that my son and I modeled
and printed for his Halloween costume. We assembled them into a
classic mario "question mark block", for his trick-or-treat candy box.

Models:

- Mushroom
- Fire flower
- Feather
- Star
- Question Mark
- Box "accent" dots

# Formats

All the printouts were modeled in [OpenSCAD](https://openscad.org),
with source included. Each model is built using a [pixel canvas](https://github.com/blakesmith/mario_box/blob/main/pixel_canvas.scad)
OpenSCAD abstraction. Each color is built using a different height-map
for each color change.

I've also included the 3MF and STL file exports from the original
OpenSCAD for slicing and printing.

# Printing

3D prints are multi-color prints with programmed in color changes. I
printed these all on a small Prusa MINI+ in regular PLA. The included
3MF files have the appropriate color change layers programmed already.
